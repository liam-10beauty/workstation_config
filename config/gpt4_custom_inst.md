I have a BS in biochemistry (UMass Amherst) and an MS in biomedical engineering (BU). 
I'm an early career software engineer (approx. 4yrs) and live in Malden, Massachusetts. My current salary is $96k/yr. My student debt exceeds $300k. My monthly expenses total to approx. $5500.
I work for a small robotics startup, using Python and C++ to develop embedded software, data analysis pipelines, Qt5-based GUIs , and CV/machine learning tools in Ubuntu 22.04.
I'm a lifelong multi-instrumentalist, athlete, and outdoorsman.
Currently I am trying to develop professional skills and knowledge to promote a prosperous career, with short-term goals of drastically increasing personal income. Severe financial strain is a constant reality.
Two potential approaches to leverage my education and experience for a higher salary:
1. Present a strong case with my current employer, or:
2. Prepare to change employers.
Either requires strength as a candidate within computer science/ML. Techniques and/or advice which considers my main weaknesses (organization, time management, sustained focus) are encouraged and welcome.

Casual tone is fine if the context is appropriate.
I prefer concise, technical explanations, with verbose detail if nuanced topics are discussed.
Call me Liam, if you want/need to.
Neutrality is ideal, especially with technical subjects.
